# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: 
    git is a version control software that tracks changes to a development in process. Github is centralized and user-friendly version of git.

Researched answer: 
    Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer:
    >, <, >=, <=, &&, ||

Researched answer: 
    &&, ||, !, ==, ===

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: 
    An index is the position that stores a value. The value is the actual content at that index.

Researched answer:
    The index of an array is the position of an element in the array. 
    The value is the actual data element stored at a particular index in the array. It can be of any data type

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer:
    An array is a container of data that can consist of any type of data type. It follows zero-based indexing rules and the value at each index can be accessed by using bracket notation.

    A string is a container for words and numbers and are wrapped in quotations. It also follows zero-based indexing rules where each character can be accessed using bracket notation

    There are some methods that can be applied to strings but not arrays and vice versa, or apply to both. 
    

Researched answer: 
    Arrays are mutable while strings are immutable (aka cannot be changed)
    Arrays are multi-dimensional (aka an array within an array within an array)
    Both arrays and strings have a .length property which provides the count of elements in the array or characteres in the string.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer:
    Pair programming consist of a driver and a navigator.
    Driver: as a driver, your job is to perform actions. This mostly include writing codes but also involve other actions like going through the git flow.
    Navigator: as a navigator, your job is to direct the driver of specific actions. This include directing what to code and steering the driver in the right direction.

Researched answer:
    Pair programming is a technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. The two programmers switch roles often, but at any given time, one is the "driver" and the other is the "navigator".

    Driver: The driver is the one who types the code in to the machine. They focus on the tactical aspects of the programming, such as syntax, and following the problem-solving strategy that has been agreed upon. They should articulate their thought process out loud for the navigator to follow along.

    Navigator: The driver, sometimes called observer, is more strategic. They are the ones who reviews the written code, looking for errors of possible improvements. The navigator is responsible for thinking ahead, considering the broader structure of the code, how the current block fits into it, and what the next steps should be. They can also look up any necessary documentation or resources to assist in problem-solving.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:
    A higher order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments, or returns a function as its result.

2. Jest:
    A JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JS codebase.

3. Objects:
    A collection of key-value pairs.

4. Method:
    A function that is a property of an object. Methods are typically used to define actions that can be performed on objects.

5. Classes:
    A template for creating objects.
